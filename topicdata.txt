insist on floor pay level for all government worker take ten thousand civil servant out social security system all together any increase be certainly welcome news however for all that whine about pressure increase minimum wage I would simply ask they would you be happy work for less than £ 5 05 hour think not so then don t expect other either I can t believe that so many this comment be against minimum wage also I personally take great offence at insinuation that person earn minimum wage be lazy at school if everyone go university then who would serve you supermarket clean up after you be about time that this hardworking person be reward with only what they deserve have earn fair pay bit respect wouldn t go miss either br gt this be good news minimum wage have put sense equality back into worker s relationship with they employer wages be suppose be fair reflection employee s effort for too long wages be point exploitation what could employer get away with very simplistic term this put pressure keep low pay wages low with minimum wage this downward pressure be at least partly remove be also interesting read comment from so call business leader they be first defend right privilege board award fat cat salary bonus pension right select few but they be first attack policy that be put place merely defend right that that really make that fat cat purr I feel there be both negative positive increase on one hand some business will struggle stay afloat but on other hand today world many young person can t afford move out as property cost too much only by earn more will they be able get on life its true many may get complacent but minimum wage could be look at as more step stone rather than hand out here come usual whine about how difficult will be for business we all remember michael howard s protestation that minimum wage would cost million job when be introduce funny how he be go quiet on that one job have continue increase since this humane legislation be bring I think if any job be worth do then be worth be pay fair wage for £ 5 05 be hardly fortune if you business can not pay its worker decent wage then maybe be not be run properly if fold good run company will take over its duty employ more person so everybody win except incompetent business owner great keep at tony I remember despair 80 low wages employer get away with at last we can make difference person reward they for work we can t afford not pay decent wage be not job at any price economy goodbye sweatshop hello decency increase minimum wage be good thing live southwest where house price rent have increase hugely like rest country over past 5 year have make live for you average 18 21 year old very difficult south west increase live cost have not be match by increase pay for example job I do plymouth be underpaid equivalent worker exeter by 75p hour hopefully increase minimum wage will bring balance pay on regional national level turn allow person like myself who do work hard but might never earn 6 figure salary chance branch out on we own I work at large hospital where contractor provide all ancillary service domestic cater portering etc pay minimum wage £ 4 85 as basic rate someone have do this unglamorous job earn enough live decently how dare person suggest we be lazy or complacent for accept this job this wages who do they think will be carry out this public service job if contractor be allow pay as little as they conscience allow this be definitely right step right direction show that this government care for low income earner as well this be million vote more good strategy isn t although I would not deny person minimum wage increase its timing stink I be quite prepared for raft bribe come from government before election raft tax afterwards they be play we for fool they think we be this be extremely bad news for any business whether they be small medium enterprise or even large company by increase overhead for business there will be almost certain rise cost consumer who while they openly welcome idea increase minimum wage be same person who still want buy that shirt or that pair trainer for next nothing extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflect price goods we buy which turn will only serve discourage company from set up business uk or encourage that company already base here look elsewhere jubilation feel by low pay worker here will soon give way misery as they lose they job this will only lead reduction job why have many call centre job go india blair say s economy be strong stable economy however consumer debt country s debt be at its high now they heap this onto business that will have no choice but cut workforce timing can not be coincidental this be blatant electioneering should be expose as such andrew derby complain that raise minimum wage be blatant electioneering I don t mind if be we degraded democracy election be one time when elite really have worry about do something concrete for majority my only complaint be paltry figure be discuss if my math be right 35 hour week at £ 5 05 give you annual income just over £ 9 000 raise £ 6 leave under £ 11 000 union should be put government under pressure for much more business complain might like take look at corporate pay shareholder payout profit before wonder if pay living wage be really controlling factor viability they firm I be all for lift minimum wage worker reasonable level but we have accept that with this will come competition from overseas worker also small business will have be able afford this manpower cost we be already see sweeping change work be lose india where person be pay much less be difficult for I understand that only five year ago cheap labour abroad be classify as sweat shop but now we be tell be global competition with we manufacturing industry serious decline country can not be entirely service industry without something tangible serve there have be something at top food chain that be manufacture whole picture need be look at this be great news but that might be because I work for minimum wage seem good idea will hopefully be incentive that who live claim actually get job when you can earn more from claim than you can from work there be no incentive perhaps step right direction if tuc get they way very large number sme will have close this will put more person out work how then will government fudge unemployment figure government know be not big business that keep economy go but sme but we always get overlook they will only take notice if this large corporation close move other country after all they be predominantly own by foreign company we be specialist company but with this increase have already have effect on we we have lose work another one will close we while I be delighted for that on low pay that this increase be be put forward I be extremely concerned at implication for small business as employee for small nursery I know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who have be unable increase salary for high pay employee because last october s increase for low pay employee who be originally be pay slightly above minimum but be now on minimum this late increase 20p hour will cause even more financial hardship if rate rise £ 6 then I can foresee many small business have pay off employee increase minimum wage will have serious effect on my business although we pay above minimum level we will have increase we pay rate maintain differential raise be well above inflation without significant increase sale will mean that I will not be take on new member staff as plan I will be look reduce total hour work by other member staff overtime be first go I currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror national minimum wage increase above inflation be fine but all my business be conduct with local authority who will not accept above inflation rise my service delivery 80 my cost be labour other aspect that be always hide be that threshold for tax credit do not move line with this increase so that all that happen be that employee tax credit support be reduce by amount increase thereby save government money but increase financial burden on small medium business be very good that government have decide increase minimum wage this should hopefully motivate person undertake low status job I know about this great idea don t bother get qualification laze about at school no need do anything other than attend so you parent don t get fine because remember when you do eventually start work doesn t matter how lazy you be you will be guarantee decent wage one who suffer be employer I hope that if industry business have pay this new rate that mr blair mr brown will increase tax allowance raise national insurance threshold so that treasury win t take some this increase off person they say they be help or be this just another form stealth tax on business through back door I don t believe minimum wage at all I think job should create they own wage value that if person want high wages they should earn they now before everyone think that I be some rich kid I can assure you I be not I come from very much work class background start work 20 year ago on youth opportunity program earn £ 25 per week I work hard go college part time get my level degree better myself I now earn 6 figure salary I do that through hard work get off my backside minimum wage just make person complacent ashley swindon when you earn £ 25 per week be worth something this day that £ 25 would need be near £ 60 have equivalent buying power I might add that thanks successive government hold down tax allowance threshold below inflation person earn minimum wage be pay tax that they never would have do 10 year ago at equivalent wages my day type argument be view that belong you day 20 year ago as graduate work for minimum wage I welcome any increase pay I can get I disagree with ashley swindon say I have work hard get more pay I have my gcse s level degree have choose work for small business that can t afford wages I should be get I should be on at least 3x what I be get but they can t afford we all work hard but money be just not there but on plus side I love my job wouldn t change just get more pay as employer staff several shop last rise minimum wage cost my company additional £ 5000 per year this next rise will cost I more I have get money from somewhere so pass on customer so no one really win end answer emma from sleaford regard no one really win end on contrary mr blair win he win because he obviously have announce this be vote winner he treasury win because as employer you will know that amount tax national insurance that government will receive from all minimum wage increase will rise course not only will be pay out high wages but as employer high employer ni contribution as well if minimum wage increase again if hit anywhere near £ 6 00 mark there will be 12 more person on employment line one more small business go bankrupt namely mine think we employer as well mr blair we be not all big corporation earn million all worker should be entitle fair day s pay for fair day s work how many person on minimum wage have any hope obtain mortgage or save towards retirement be good news for many Asian live uk student who do odd job can increase they income can help there family they home country I

venue also they should do more help independent record label have loud voice within industry dominate by commercialised major label rather than expect government I e taxpayer fork out why don t some megastar put something back some britain s wealthy person be musician who have rake from album concert etc there be far more important demand on government fund if they can fund football why not fund music area art be fund by government lottery grant so why not music we already have opera receive huge grant would clearly be beneficial for diversity music have same opportunity other area music only problem would be how judge what merit state cash government have enough problem fund school health service if alex kaprano genuinely think multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then he own education be seriously lack more money should be put into that as scot live england I appreciate value Scottish music culture be success so I can see no problem with franz ferdinand travis snow patrol be just recent example success Scottish music can have world so we should do what we scot be good at support we own goods I think issue be more fundamental should government be spend money on subsidise multi million pound industry when health education be such sorry state answer be most definitely no that person who be lucky enough pursue they passion get they pay cheque shouldn t be look for government subsidy I know that if I be lucky enough be able pursue my dream show jumping I would want finance myself until I be position pursue corporate sponsorship yes government should fund music bring joy mass there be already thousand state fund musician out there sit around twiddle they thumb on new deal get government even more involved would only waste money that could be put well use as long as government be fund real talent would be great move I would hate see more pop idol type funding music though as would only serve reinforce stereotype that alex talk about only if proposal make financial sense franz ferdinand must be pay serious amount tax on they record sale if they d have government grant get start they d have more than pay back by now so treasury would be make far more than pay out however government have good thing spend its money on than give charity everyone who decide they be musician government shouldn t fund music should invest music that investment should be treat like any other investment I think government need provide facility for young group band form practise equipment be not cheap can be well beyond means many person however I do feel this should be extent they role provide condition for talent flourish let go from there I do agree that government should help fund music but there be also responsibility hold by record company they generally always opt for try test tend not want break any mould or risk lose any money which ultimately director be business for if label be more willing put money forward towards small breakthrough act then government wouldn t have fork out great deal yeah why not music should be government fund particularly work modern composer veteran band artist stuff pop music pretty much rule earth so more attention should go other fraternity I agree with fund art make more accessible public but I be not convince that pop music require financial support from taxpayer there be great deal money generate through pop music perhaps tax on pop could be plough into public performance other form music for everyone enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music that be music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever that which be specifically design line pocket music producer call tax on music pollution if you like though I really like franz ferdinand I have disagree with mr kaprano once government get they hand into private sector will destroy creative possibly controversial avenue artist pursue many year ago

completely put off just leave this classic alone as good memory I think remake be good idea as world move on person tend look more more into past thing that make they feel safe I believe this be whole reason retro have become so popular as long as remake do justice original then all can do be create wide audience possibly entice new generation person enjoy revive old series personally I would like see cartoon such as transformer thundercat be s k get full hollywood remake leave they alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memory first place thunderbird film be apall not patch on

because be all kick tooth at end day be not really relevant if joss stone be close thing that they feel comfortable champion because what she look like how she sound who she be sign then so be be get nothing do with what be really go on urban as genre be very broad if you look underneath urban there be number core element that include hip hop r b garage into that obviously come soul joss stone be soul artist she first album be call soul session so urban be very broad brushstroke that be umbrella over top sub genre there be offshoot all that joss stone have have amazing success we give that she be uk artist what have really capture everybody s imagination be that here you have 17 year old from devon with voice die for bunch really really good tune she look good I think that be what be do

especially street music that originate from city typically reflect or be characteristic urban life she might not be urban but when do r b become hip hop taint thing be now r b stand for rhythm blues remember that joss stone be rubbish be certain if anyone deserve win award for urban music I think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its street although dizzee rascal stake good claim she definitely deserve win prize joss stone s album be quite simply amazing easily good than anything else that be release last year this whole debate about what be urban what isnt urban be completely pointless probably fuel by urban artist who weren t nominate or didn t win I cant see why person can t just congratulate she for talent that she be she do deserve but I agree with comment about urban music its stupid phrase particularly British state they tend use hip hop be b if I say hip hop here lot person have no idea what I be talk about very strange what be name rose by any other name etc if person want call urban why not if we really analyse term dance music be misleading because doesn t describe everything you can dance whilst I agree that term urban be open interpretation strike I as simply weird that joss stone have win urban I be what I hear be play party inner city I live brixton have never hear soul session pump out bass heavy sound system any party I have be good luck joss stone let s celebrate she victory let s also question why with artist so successful talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia key outkast we didn t see single black artist on stage collect award so what you be say be that any music that have black heritage be not allow be sing by anyone who isn t black if be then they shouldn t be acknowledge for even if they be pretty dam good at she be 17 have amazing voice win good on she oh but she be not black well let s make she feel real bad about then how dare she though hang on didn t so call public vote on this one this idea pigeonhole whatever be popular at time be no different than what be happen 1940 50 relation what jazz be media then call anything that have swinging beat syncopate melody or soulful feeling jazz much chagrin artist would mean that blues would be put same mould as bebop cool ragtime all very different style at that time jazz be remain such massively misunderstand term so what urban music truth be lazy term categorise music that you don t really understand soul garage be world apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have they connection if we just let music speak for itself not judge success artist by number award win then maybe we can enjoy music for what be rather than what represent I demand prize for rural music suck city be way good out here we have hay for one thing exclude she from what have become know as urban music would be as bad as exclude lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for be black surely I do not understand point that ty be make if lemar who make music which be less soulful than joss work win he might have say nothing btw I be black too how can she be urban if she spend most she life devon countryside nonsense I love joss bit don t care what she branding be be amazing music full stop stop pute all bracket let s just call music let s especially drop black urban tag nearly all music come from black origin this just set example that be ok pigeonhole person they music by they colour surely point have urban music category be simply acknowledge artist that be make what be historically consider urban music irrelevent colour they skin or where they originate from joss stone be simply sing certain type music that can be consider urban style just as someone from inner city indeed not from usa could sing country music if that person be good at authentic sound would we criticise be refer as country music or artist for represent that style term urban reference music genre uk have develop part from controversy surround branding mobo award very term music black origin have confuse offend many person this be particularly strange give existence Asian music award appear that use black or white relation music make person feel uncomfortable term urban therefore have be invoke sidestep debate which type music come first black or white thereby render issue colourblind result be now redundant new debate as what urban also mean perhaps we should have create new term altogether describe various strain soul rnb hip hop one which do not also mean something else as we have do with crunk urban be just word that be come about recently describe black music that be become popular now word wasn t even use or common use five six year ago be just way industry clumping all together without have call black music because some person be oversensitive might call they racist for I be band that have be call urban I despise label I would hate think I belong any neat marketing niche because that s all be ever since music channel record comapny try fracture what they consider music black origin this label have be use undermine status good music into commodity look at all tv broadcaster unable reach young person without condesend they simply play some urban music on soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore label be what be just music as black man I think I agree with some statement at least statement make by key executive black person should lead music they invent we should stop call genre meaningless northing be meaningless real question be would joss stone would have be that successful do music she be do if she be black same thing with street amy winehouse etc who be ever hear terri walker or rhian benson they be both 10 time good than joss stone both they have win urban music award I think mobo but why not brit so what if joss stone win urban award she music be great soul surely that be under urban banner what if street have win would person be whine because mike skinner be white seem that lot fuss be about race where real issue should be music nothing else urban be pc version for say black music I be not doubt ms stone s talent but why didn t jamelia or lemar get brit this remind I what happen craig david soul ii soul past get nomination be easy get but pick up brit seem be hard thing refreshing see person make reasonable intelligent comment on any topic this day more power you person you have say there be music you like music you don t like who care what label you put on that entire category be mess how can you have person like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like put eminem against bob geldof she should have be nominate for good British r b act joss stone deserve win award for she talent but I don t think be very urban she sing angel with robbie william urban be nonsense term music black origin well doesn t that include rock music make inner city well almost all band end up make music london manchester etc doesn t that make some weird implication that all black person live city doesn t make any sense why do music have be put into genre be music you like or you don t simple as that I play heavy metal band we be urban music as far as I be concerned we live city spend we work life urban environment therefore directly shape what we write musically urban seem be new name for all style black music why need rebrand I don t know as name be mislead oasis originate from city characterise urban life they know therefore more than fit term urban yet as they be white rock band they win t be describe as such joss stone have fantastic voice great timing delivery what other reason do they need award she brit all this urban other such categorisation be just red tape music business be good ignore yeah she deserve she be talented urban be crap meaningless politically correct probably actually racist marketing term though there be only two kind music good bad

bbc sport pundit former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insist talk on new investment be ongoing but add door have not close on shareholder lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive july 1998 from similar role at premier league there have be several high low during he time charge at anfield he have busy summer oversee arrival new manager rafael benitez manage hold on steven gerrard on subject liverpool s captain prize asset parry reveal real madrid do ask for option on england midfield man during negotiation for striker fernando moriente he say they be look for way say they get more out deal for fernando moriente but response real madrid be same steven be not for sale but when ask if gerrard would be liverpool player on first day next season parry say I sincerely hope he will be steven know my view he know rafa s view we have re affirm recently steven that we be try build team around he we crave success as much as he do we know he be ambitious nobody can argue with that I think steven would dearly love win thing with liverpool more than he would like do anything else we all want see progress by next season he be not alone that there be lot other player who feel same so we all have common aim be expect chelsea will test liverpool with £ 30m plus bid summer but parry claim he will be no mood listen there have be lot open secret about steven most which have be complete myth be suggest we have deal tie up last summer we didn t have offer last summer parry explain we have tell chelsea that as far as we be concern he be not for sale we didn t want sell he reality didn t go beyond that maybe there will be offer summer maybe there win t we position be we want steven stay but we be also realistic enough have enough respect for steven he have enough respect for we know that be he decision that will be crucial you be not go keep player like steven against he will that just doesn t work but any idea we be go accept offer for steven then tell he by way we have decide sell you be not on agenda you can forget that parry be currently process finalise funding for liverpool s new stadium stanley park which be set open 2007 he confess arsenal s £ 100m deal with emirate sponsor they new ground complete with name right have give anfield club serious food for thought he say I have say historically be something I have be against I have be on record as say that but I think size arsenal deal be real eye opener I would say past deal have be do frankly far too cheaply just hasn t even be worth contemplate but arsenal deal be sort deal that cause you draw breath say wow that be interesting my personal point view be that I would find hell lot more palatable than share stadium some liverpool fan would find such move highly controversial but parry counter I recognise would be emotive issue for many supporter but you look at amount money available could go into team if be right partner how strong issue be time will tell I think stadium will always be anfield not least because where be but do we need investigate possibility sponsorship I think would be remiss not that s not say we have make decision that we will go down that road but I think be clearly something we have explore on subject possible new investment parry reveal liverpool be still negotiation with mystery investor with rumour interest from middle east that prompt withdrawal tycoon steve morgan who get frustrate by fail bid what he claim be indecision by board he also accuse liverpool use he as stalk horse attract other bid but parry explain steve have never be use as stalk horse there be no need that be not way we do business we have discussion with steve over course 2004 I think we come close conclude deal summer but didn t happen quite genuinely new interest do appear relatively late day just prior agm december as I have say be such potential magnitude that potential be so exciting we feel we have evaluate we be still evaluate steve s interest be take very much on its own merit he enthusiasm for club be there for all see who know what next few month will hold door isn t close on anything we have perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have common interest make liverpool successful that be dream we all share so as far as I be concern door be not close I would take £ 50m if we have no investment but if we do keep he as for stadium if get we cash what difference do make really £ 50m for gerrard I don t care who you be director would take money be way should be we can not let that sum money go despite gerrard s quality through cleverly word statement club have effectively force gerrard publicly make decision for himself which I think be right thing do critical time for liverpool with regards gerrard ideally we would want secure he future club for long term I be hope he doesn t walk out club like michael owen do for very little cash £ 50m realistically would allow rafa completely rebuild squad however if we can afford do this keep gerrard we will be good for I would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over £ 35m parry s statement be clever that any future gerrard transfer can not be construe as lack ambition by club not try keep they good player up ante be another smart move by parry I would keep gerrard no amount money could replace he obvious love club determination succeed key be if gerrard come out say that he be happy clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not sell worrying thing be who would you buy or who would come pend possible non champion league football

iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat josef stalin trigger cold war with berlin blockade 1948 my whole generation be blight by we be threaten by nuclear holocaust nuclear wind nuclear winter we build shelter that would have shelter nothing we spend we treasure on weapon instead hospital we take silly precaution some fight some march futilely against some pretend be not there cold war last 43 year but we remain parliamentary democracy by early seventy be terrorism as well al fatah black september red brigade but most all for we ira inla thirty more year 300 policeman woman over 600 soldier more than 3 000 civilian dead but we win because even ira bomb could not force we become tyranny that be why tyrant lose civil right be infringe as little as humanly possible evidence have be take secret protect covert source yes one judge no jury court have be institute when jury be terrorise informant have be give immunity from they own crime win big battle but habeas corpus do not die right appeal be not abolish now threat be Islamic fundamentalism its leader want destroy we society so do ira be base fund abroad so be ira have sleeper fanatic inside we society so do ira be extremely hard penetrate with we agent so be ira prime mover be not easy bring trial neither be ira but we do without become tyranny now blair government propose law system fascism communism citizen can be arrest hold without charge or trial not even on careful consideration experienced judge but whim political activist call government minister be protect from terror government say we must become tyranny but tyranny be base on citizen s terror this be not victory this be defeat before shot be fire interesting article its good see widen participation debate but I suggest we move one step far we own bomb bullet will can only shatter peace because invade foreign nation imprison innocent hunting shadow can not destroy evil mind hatred within heart rather than focus upon effect we should consider cause because terrorism do not begin with bomb why not try foreign policy compassion can only enhance we democracy share we freedom I agree with frederick forsyth we really can t deal with terrorism by turn britain into fascist state what we really need be more honesty from we security service we politician if they do not have evidence bring this person trial there probably isn t any we security service behave like detective who have decide that certain person be guilty rake over all kind obscure flimsy evidence try prove while real villain get away remember there be no wmd iraq just because person may have make some stupid naive decision life do not make they terrorist this overly politically correct society be good see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes there have be oppression by British government past overstep mark place like ireland but yes we be still democracy where be rare be arrest without charge trial etc apart from number prisoner belmarsh goal for example this country sign up human right then pretend that they only apply person with nothing fear innocent person define by whom when id card become mandatory datum collect will not be protect by datum protection act will be readily available person like gchq with no control by person whose id be be check threat now be new you can not compare threat past year with now forsyth say 3000 die over 30 year or terrorism 3000 person die one morning ny on september 11th 2001 threat today be that terrorist will acquire nuclear or biological technology kilo semtex will flatten build kilo plutonium will flatten city you now have combination person who will perform terrorist act with technology that be rapidly become accessible I agree government be probably encourage degree mass hysteria talk up threat but talk down threat do nothing be unacceptable too problem with this issue be not that isn t important but fact that general we brit can be so politically apathetic some time that we will just let this go without tell government no however as nation that give world common law true sense right individual liberty I hope this will prove be one step too far as somebody Chinese origin I can say that this country use be good place migrate start new life whilst life wasn t perfect we could make good for ourselves now we be riddled with red tape be tell what we can or can not do we have be politically correct we be not allow have belief or opinion we have prime minister who spend too much time meddle we politics affair which have little do with life British citizen at home or abroad mr forsyth have do good job voice he opinion let s hope bbc doesn t get gag for let person express they view person have right know bbc s role be inform educate entertain I agree terrorist intend spread fear but reality be government which have spread fear by its constant publicising this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow they ride roughshod over we right liberty end very thing we seek protect be what we be give up name safety from this invisible enemy terrorist have already win I absolutely agree with frederick forsyth yes we have defend ourselves against terrorism but exist law seem be more than adequate idea that new terrorism demand new power be erroneous evidence any real terrorist capability uk be scant ricin for example be dangerous poison but be not weapon mass destruction what be really worry be enthusiasm mr blair he government for authoritarian reaction attempt manipulate electorate through fear if government have its way with id card track so on then totalitarianism have win as such then matter little whether we give terrorist demand or not we will have lose precious freedom which bush blair constantly tell we we have that they seek bring other I agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth I be shocked at ease with which this government be prepare wipe out major portion liberty that British person have enjoy for century right not be deprive we liberty without trial open court that go right back magna carta ordinary person have spill they blood enforce that right against government who think they know good when you look at today s britain you realise george orwell be only wrong about one thing date frederick forsyth put beautifully government be seek introduce police state new power home internment without trial follow pattern which include introduction surveillance via compulsory id card link datum basis together with un British idea that we will have swear allegiance state at age 18 year we be sleep walk into this wake up interesting view but miss two crucial fact this new threat 1 if this terrorist acquire weapon mass destruction they will use they without fear mutually assure destruction that keep cold war state tense balance this person will use devastating force against we without fear any consequence 2 terrorist be prepare use suicide bomber which mean they could kill innocent person on london underground we could do very little stop because this terrorist be potentially so deadly we have come up with new tough response will be little late day when person outside london wake up one morning find out that london have be nuke we win t have much society leave debate he be correct most what he say mind you he do seem have forget that disgraceful internment policy northern ireland which probably cause many idealistic if misguided young catholic join ira administrative detention Muslim could have similar effect now surely we public would be good protect if security service rather than alert suspect terrorist by place they under house arrest for how long they be place suspect terrorist under surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute or even good prevent terrorist attack I don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing view but this time he have get spot on there be no doubt that there be terrorist organisation who would like do harm u k but be very doubtful whether al qaeda be global organisation co ordinate this rise surveillance camera id card plan charge for road use by track every vehicle at all time this be stuff nightmare add this this new legislation which effectively mean that protection law will be remove from anyone at whim home secretary I genuinely wonder what sort world my two child will inherit where will this end as stand terrorist do not need attack u k be government will soon have be person terrorise more that they could very achieve with few bomb mr forsyth have express exactly what my gut fear reservation be about this propose legislation but could not verbalise thank you mr forsyth seem forget that killing trouble occur on both side religious divide be carry out by killer from both side he also forget basic human right be suspend then as now experience judge sit over some great miscarriage justice during that time for very little return maximum alienation this law emphasis on Islamic threat will just do same forsyth be wrong nature current threat be new be no longer we armed force as soviet threat eastern bloc be be you I terrorist aim kill indiscriminately good comparison be therefore blitz 1941 at this time let we not forget suspect foreign British be routinely round up intern for duration war without any complaint from public we must not forget we be at war I would say that that likelihood attack by sleeper cell fundamentalist lunatic against major uk target be when not if probability I will bet any money you like that day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be say that government didn t do enough protect uk person like forsyth can only see one side any argument for he be side that be opposite new labour tony blair I agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth very reason this country have be such wonderful place live be under attack not from terrorist but from this government perpetuation perceive terrorist threat be not because what alleged terrorist be do but from we own government I believe what this government be do be at very least highly questionable at bad sinister at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person British isle when we be all tag monitor constantly we freedom be be craftily surreptitiously whittle away by this government we be gain nothing should be great concern everyone I be slightly old than mr forsyth therefore have live through same history as he I be against police state would not like think that I live one I think that attack on iraq make international situation bad may have provoke further act terrorism how true there be extremely worrying parallel between britain now germany during 30 s I never think would be so easy take over country from within mr forsyth have forget one key point terrorist who threaten britain today be well aware that hitler stalin ira all fail as result modern day terrorist be willing do thing they predecessor do not that do not mean that civil liberty modern britain must be erode counter threat that should always be absolute last resort but meet new threat defeat sinister fanaticism today s terrorist we may need do thing little differently let we hope not frederic forsythe s comment seem I be well think out analysis why we human society as whole britain particular should resist temptation over protect through fear be this fear which enable terrorist succeed end terrorist can come all form as mr forsythe s opening comment suggest I be remind quote attribute thoma jefferson nation that limit freedom name security will have neither government be face with incredibly difficult task have make policy deal with be all very well criticise that policy but if mr forsythe can t draw on he year experience offer alternative I say so what he opinion frederick forsyth s rhetoric be absurd he conclusion laughable he distort reality serve he own prejudice against new labour this government seek balance protection we democracy with minimum loss civil right be frederick forsyth who be extremist because he do not appreciate need for balance I rarely find myself agree with my forsyth but this instance I think he be correct rule law must prevail civil liberty be worth defend if government can hold suspect without charge or trial what be next I agree absolutely by introduce fascist type law we loose moral high ground we fight against terror we democratic system be not perfect but as churchill point out be good than all other that have be try terrorist attack will take place but for many reason we should take that personal risk return for personal freedom I do not usually agree with mr forsyth but he be spot on here single big threat we face be that government dedicate act illegally manipulate international national law suit its own purpose totalitarianism always require outside threat justify range extraordinary power leader want British government be far great threat that terrorist organisation although principle I agree with he frederick forsyth fail address one key point al qaeda attack though obviously there have be none yet uk seek kill maximum number person ira want limit death toll they attack so as maintain support among Republican movement yes I agree with mr forsyth s view I do not believe government s plan be justify there be over reaction negative influence we president s interpretation democracy freedom he use same argument that be current before wwii war liberate iraq afghanistan with syria iran come we be leave poor inheritance for future generation mr forsyth be wonderful writer should keep he fiction where belong British government be not go down road that mr forsyth suggest sadly comment such as he will make lot person believe that they be govern by person who be fast become tyrant instead be genuinely commit stop tyranny even if method employ do that be at moment alien British person who have live democracy protect by tony blair other like mind who mr forsyth seem be put along side scruffy little Austrian thoma hobbe would be smile he grave at labour s proposition like new labour he call himself Libertarian like new labour he believe he be promote person s good interest but as forsythe criticise this government hobbe have be criticise by most subsequent philosopher for argue he way into hand totalitarian simply put he argue that favour ultimate liberty liberty live man should be prepare surrender all other liberty supreme sovereign as protection against he fellow barbaric man hobbe have be roundly condemn by posterity rightly so I hope new labour suffer same treatment I agree with mr forsyth s view government approach be totally against spirit British democracy they must not be allow get away with course frederick be wrong about britain win war against ira he be wrong too about country not become tyranny have he forget about shoot kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squad etc my background be somewhat similar freddie s so I be persuade agree with many he sentiment we can have no moral justification for impose we system government on anyone while we be systematically deprive we own citizen basic individual collective freedom whilst principle keep potential terrorist under house arrest might seem superficially attractive be unfortunately also first step towards totalitarianism who be decide whom be suspect why should we believe they who can have faith honesty integrity competence we intelligence service politician light event recent year what be stop false denunciation what that falsely accuse who will lose they career who will support they family will they child still go school smack I method Nazi germany stalin s russia ceausescu s romania list go on look as if new dark age be come I see that opinion on mr forsyth s remark be divide problem I see be that that who support imprisonment without trial believe will never happen they or they family only person they don t like or be scared but history have show that if you have law like that they always get abuse by that power after all today you may be scare same person as that power but someday that power may be scare you that day you will be one imprison without chance justice we law be such that you can not just be imprison at whim we police force you have be show be deserving if we imprison person without trial for indeterminate period we be no well that that we be fight I never think possible for I agree with single word utter by frederick forsyth but I be wholehearted agreement with he on this one we as nation be grave danger be dupe by pro we propaganda which course also mean we will inherit most if not all they total paranoia allow we government any political persuasion incidentally gradually insidiously impose police state by well try test back door method I grieve for future my child be no wonder they be adamant they don t ever want any they own this government with much fanfare sign we up European convention on human right but now want introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this put on par with government burma like many you respondent I wouldn t usually think mr forsyth as someone whose view I share but instance oppose charle clark s proposal for house arrest I agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth I agree with mr forsyth just look at fact we government along with we invade another sovereign country iraq by select intelligence that back be case base on fear fact turn out be very different if individual be treat same distorted way then we have do ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bomb we become animal too I agree many way with what mr forsyth have say if we be be respect have influence within world we must be see be walk walk as well as talk talk how can we accuse country such as zimbabwe burma human right abuse when we be lock up person who may be totally innocent be hypocrisy high order mr forsyth link Islamic fundamentalism new threat however appear that he have misunderstand term Islamic fundamentalism should be point out that Muslim who adhere true fundamental qur aan teaching last prophet muhammad be Islamic fundamentalist this person do not commit suicide any shape or form nor do she he kill innocent woman man child this person be self reflective constantly try better she he action by be good other person who mr forsyth label new threat be that who do not follow correct teaching islam they have arrive at they own interpretation assumption with regard they action on top that they claim be follow islam its true form I accept that intention this policy be make britain safe place but I can not think single example from history where do this sort thing have ever make any difference northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything bombing didn t stop could be argue that all achieve be just supply ira with yet more angry resentful Republican willing take up arm against British be eight year old than frederick forsyth survivor blitz on london be easy agree with he he be absolutely spot on during ira bombing there be massive explosion canary wharf right where I write this also leave city london notwithstanding this attempt nearly successful assassination attempt on prime minister thatcher brighton on later occupant 10 downing street there be no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there have be on afghanistan iraq even when england be true peril 1940 apart from some detention there be no wholesale derogation habeas corpus like we have see off this late attempt on we liberty include id card which winston churchill decide have go since he say average bobby on beat could not be rely on not be tempt take undue advantage against citizen go about they lawful activity incidentally I can still remember my old id card number hence be clear that far too great police state power set for statute book have be resist neuter what can I add mr forsyth s eloquently put argument except applause well do that man for stand up be count war against tyranny

groundbreaking presumably age range that could be bother vote be be pretty low I be actually embarrassed be British if that be good song we have produce last 25 year what about special ghost town buzzcock ever fall love with someone happy monday kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear we apart angel be middle road rubbish angel be awful piece sentimental claptrap be musically lyrically inept fantastically overrate bit like mr william himself this result isn t very surprising though brit have long history celebrate rubbish music good last 25 year maybe cunning make timescale not include stairway heaven or bohemian rhapsody but do kind make bit hollow award really not much competition last 25 year after all be alright for pop song but good song last 25 year there be no way on earth that song should have be vote good last 25 year be travesty rubbish who vote for be include any list I be regular listener radio 2 but I don t recall invitation vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal mass who wouldn t know good song if jump up bite they on nose but be certainly not good song last 25 year how depressing just when we think manufacture pop be on way out where on earth do this dreadful list appear from while I be biass that I think love will tear we apart should have win all seriousness I think that good song last 25 year should not include song less than 5 year old as that would exclude song which be popular because novelty then again well do robbie good show you have get be kid angel be great song but not good song last 25 year only good song be up for nomination at brit I think angel be great song deserve be run up for this award but I don t think its good song from past 25 year right enough be good than some other this catergory for example what be will young do be nominate first place he be alright but song isn t that good I be happy for robbie himself though good song last 25 year what joke think all great rock pop song release 80 pretty much all they be good than angel phil collin doesn t deserve award for all good song he write angel be overrate song that get tiresome even before you have finish listen soppy rubbish at good hopefully manufacture rubbish will die down soon let real artist who work hard for there glory receive award so boringly obvious typical bland nature mainstream music britain today for I be proof that music democracy just don t mix still at least wasn t will young oh be all just bit fun person take this award too seriously robbie have million loyal fan while even non fan know word angel he win obviously reflect who vote this award personally I want will young win but that be not really due he musical talent I hate song all bring back be memory school disco no one slow dance with I agree about angel I never get feed up hear whenever song come on radio I turn radio up smile sing along very badly that be why radio have be turn up drown my voice out song make I calm serene happy well do robbie I think that although robbie williams be good performer that angel isn t really that good song certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear we apart by joy division or wuther height by kate bush angel be fantastic song all credit robbie williams guy chamber be song that will be play forever bridge all age group robbie do no way deserve that mantle whenever we have this award be always artist from past five year that seem win good good we forget about late 80 early 90 for example they weren t cool at time but because they be cool again now show that song have great longevity than person think yes angel be good song since past 25 year because touch soul as carry lot mean I have always dislike angel intensely I believe be symbolic general capacity British pre teens teens middle aged woman accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwrit be orrible seem obvious I that person who like robbie be person who don t particularly like music all that much folk without collection folk who have never engage that madness one experience when fall under spell pop music angel add nothing be merely irritating distraction wasp that refuse go away on summer s afternoon picnic what dreadful result if you vote for you should feel ashamed yourself you probably only know dozen song or so don t you so where do get off apply this uninformed filter cast this ridiculous vote booo hisss angel good song you be kid right last five year I might be willing accept but 25 no way do whoever vote for this actually have any music knowledge prior say 1995 really quite insulting British music industry past quarter century no surprise about robbie williams consider list where on earth do nomination list come from compile by eleven year old girl perhaps I mean will young come on what load crap good song last 25 year I don t think so what about all real artist out there over last 25 year list be endless but robbie williams doesn t even come close what joke that song have become such bane I that I have develop pavlovian response word angel where I thrash around scream no no no no no until someone tell I radio s off why half bake cheesy ditty like angel which have become anthem for million romantic sop think how many time be sing on pop idol for example by whom should be vote good song past 25 year be beyond I if this be song against which all other be judge then musician may as well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly this country initial list be very weak anyway but angel good song last 25 year I think not I didn t realize radio 2 have so many listener under age 10 person have such short memory great song yes but good last 25 year not chance I think person as oppose song have be vote for here great British public at work again be mediocre sentimental safe song grant be not too bad either but can stand up against anything by smith particular how soon be now or anything from stone rose first album nope no because I be not female I be not 10 ok I like robbie angel be decent song but be no way good song past 25 year shortlist wasn t great but he win be joke predictable laughable success angel at this year brit reflect poorly on state British music over last 25 year British public be brainwash by corporate pulp that be presnete they as cut edge music true talent be be sadly miss whilst angel be popular song be not even good song robbie s repertoire never mind good song last 25 year I be huge robbie fan love that song but I think there be lot more outstanding song music out there that influence music today unfortunately they be leave out list have radio 2 listener even hear joy division band who through two album have have big impact on music continue do so over last 25 year than robbie williams ever will no doubt about there be not song do by anyone with more emotion feel some person will adopt they slightly snobby stance but angel have hit home with far large audience than any other song should have be joy division that guy have play influential part shape modern day music while angel remain yet another pop song I sincerely do not believe that 25 year from now most influential artist will argue that robbie williams inspire they art way that byrd beatle nick drake have do for music today yes I think its brilliantly write song with different meaning different person there be other great song category but somebody have win robbie be deserved winner I be astounded that such second rate record have beat such line up amazing song be terrible song vote for by mass who don t have brain appreciate innovative exciting music good song past 25 year really come on this be surely joke no I think I need long lie down just go show that British public do not have clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over beautifully talented kate bush joy division I suppose be confirm one thing British public be consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease there must be thousand good song than formulate cheesy pop song for kid no one agree with this quite frankly be embarassment integrity British music further nail coffin I think robbie deserve he have be most iconic any star we have have britain since john lennon be idol million worldwide anybody who say he doesn t deserve be jealous he success only real challenger be queen but hey another one bite dust obviously all karaoke singer uk vote for if this be good song last 25 year then British music industry be trouble sure robbie be talented produce excellent material but this be not good record sad day for music be not type music I normally like but even as diehard rock fan I recognise that be good song appela most person that be why have be vote good song last 25 year be good all rounder just like robbie good song 25 year since 1980 I be confused angel isn t bad song be nice catchy formulaic anthem that tick all box but this be not great music if anything be regressive bland even I suppose be just more evidence how redundant brit award have become grant angel be good song however really wasn t up against any other proper competition queen s song be lackluster apart from kate bush other choice be pathetic also why weren t stone there david bowie etc there be so many great song than angel I wonder if be simply fact that robbie wasn t get more

june s European election while ukip have turn its back on British person I shall not he say I will be stand at next general election I shall be lead vigorous campaign for cause I believe unlike old party we shall be honest open straight mr hockney also leave ukip say mr kilroy silk would deliver good as leader eurosceptic party spokesman for ukip call on mr hockney quit london assembly party assert that mr hockney have moral obligation if not legal one stand down its leader roger knapman have say he be glad see back mr kilroy silk he have remarkable ability influence person but sadly after European election become clear that he be more interested robert kilroy silk party than uk independence party so be nice know he now goodbye he say ukip official also argue mr kilroy silk have not be straightforward attack party he once want lead verita be bnp expensive suit be all well good robert kilroy silk claim that veritas be party that doesn t believe lie spin but truth matter be its completely useless due proportional representation there be no chance that verita will have any chance claim power change two horse race trend my opinion this be just publicity stunt which have just be use as smoke screen for he anti islamism slur which get he sack from television I think that he view regard immigration be share by many really be time that uk government cease be paper tiger on this issue addition as ashfield constituent I would be more than interested kilroy silk oppose geoff hoon good see party right splintering way party leave have always do let s hope kilroy silk ukip euro sceptic wing tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth debate about europe we benefit enormously from we membership eu we need be at heart europe lead drive where we as country want go not run away from all mouth trousers clown trouble be any vote he collect may just end up help new labour into third term whatever kilroy silk ukip do none they anti European policy have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact wale or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic party will allow they slip out way get person vote for real political party which address more than one issue england need europe survive as soon as person realise this good we can t rely on usa forever at last impetus for increase likely 40 turn out for election electorate be disillusion with British politics kilroy have one agenda uk I will be vote for he both ukip rk s be representative small mindedness lack vision for whole humankind interest humanity world lie so much beyond scope this person s bickering that who overall scheme thing really care about they petty tiff many person believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switch horse midstream then bad mouth steed that get you halfway seriously diminish you credibility very idea political party bear out such negative feeling as euroscepticism or British supremacy be nauseate one can only hope public recognise this extremist for what they be shun they at poll I have always think that kilroy silk be self publicise egotist this news do absolutely nothing alter my opinion brilliant about time this country have plausible party have see recent bbc 3 documentary witness thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour number senior ukip figure I can well understand why kilroy silk feel embarrassed be associate with such person hopefully ukip member who be interested political debate will support he action fantastic news pro European now have far less worry about from right conservative be as confuse as they have be since mid 1990 extreme anti European be fracture themselves into splinter group that split any vote they might get local European general election robert kilroy silk s ego vanity be he own he supporter bad enemy as euro enthusiast I could not be more delighted by kilroy silk s behaviour he take party that be just build up head steam have expose ridicule by attempt coup d etat he be now set about serious business divide two close straight down middle good as far as I be concerned but any eventuality two sceptic party will exhaust they energy fight each other if every politician with ambition lead they party resort form they own for that purpose we d have ballot paper mile long you have get hand kilroy silk for he sheer arrogance supreme self belief whilst not be great fan kilroy I do agree with he comment about ukip leadership like he I be also leave ukip I believe countless opportunity have be lose discredit eu show we person what belong eu really mean eu s comment last week about michael howard s plan reform immigration show how little we govern we own country when they can turn round say immigration be matter for eu not individual member state soon we leave this corrupt super state good do anyone else think that be ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk have use latin name for he new party rather than good old British name be this indicative man contradictory vain pompous I think mr kilroy silk have get very good point British politics have become too pc as result have no straight talk honest strong politician they be all interested they own career not person who put they power as result I feel we democracy be be abuse I want stop if mr kilroy silk live up half he promise he will get my vote honestly who really care man with tan leave party with no plan set up party with no idea as one kilroy silk s east midland constituent I hope that who vote for he be proud have be take by such charming vacuity I feel insult by have he represent I European parliament ukip try hard accommodate robert kilroy silk but he make clear that only control would satisfy he someone so keen on complete control be bind fall foul ukip s democratic nature kilroy be able communicator capable politician exactly way that who lead ukip be not he try make work but they didn t seem want grow up he be leave position have defend they gaffe media this new party seem logical next step for kilroy good luck man I say oh please this be amusing irrelevance there be absolutely no chance either this party communicate sensible constructive eurosceptic argument they will play key part win country round idea reform more democratic more dynamic europe union future generation will thank he for he ridiculousness refreshing thing about robert be that he be open honest straight what other politician can claim this I have suspicion that he talk for large part electorate that he critic would like I shall be vote for he electorate east midland vote not for kilroy silk but for ukip kilroy silk be make mep because he position on ukip s party list he have no mandate represent area should resign from European parliament I wouldn t write off kilroy silk while he be clown one man band at moment he be populist that be always dangerous man clearly have enormous ego look at we current political master that seem be one factor success good luck kilroy though I think he be do more harm than good for both he new party ukip because they vote base be not strong enough for both party be successful at moment ukip have upper hand while verita be start from square one fight somewhat uphill battle man I once find cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out be my country s knight shine armour he express view which be now more than common amongst society today but person be almost too scared express they kilroy silk have secure my vote many more like I what be more I look forward day when he claim victory wreck eu rescue my great nation without hair out place he tan as perfect as ever great stuff long uk dither over europe rich we ireland become as only English speak country fully commit europe oh send we over that hard working immigrant we economy need they this be just what europhile pray for as main eurosceptic party ukip should try resolve its difference with kilroy show united front give uk public serious political voice against europe have multiple party with same view point just split vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk have go now ukip at least have chance election be very sad see cause britain regain its proper relationship with europe damage by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have lot offer instead we have split party damage cause under present electoral system person must work together small party have no hope representation last summer ukip achieve major advance partly only partly due kilroy silk be great shame this have be dissipate fight ukip have wide platform policy not just withdrawal from eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignore comment surround launch he own party neither English Democrat nor new party be interested let he join they take over they leadership speak volume verita be beginning end for kilroy silk if he believe truth democracy then he two assembly member should resign force by election stand on they own platform rather than this backdoor approach politics be elect for one party then defect another so ukip be good enough for he lead not good enough for he follow interesting that party commit plain speaking should have latin name every opinion poll point overwhelming anti europe feel this country kilroy silk could be on verge something huge if he can broaden he appeal beyond this one issue he be extremely able communicator with year political experience we want quality school top hospital clean efficient public transport punishment that fit crime limited asylum purge on bureaucracy less tax need courage honesty two quality sadly lack we politician kilroy silk may just have that very quality recruit right colleague robert you time may have come well if you can not get enough limelight be ordinary mp then go out start up you own party be all flash no real policy here let s hope this be start both ukip kilroy silk slip into obscurity verita
